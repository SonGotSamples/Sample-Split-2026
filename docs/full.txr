1. Fuzzy Match & Song Identification
Improve fuzzy song matching using RapidFuzz for 99%+ accuracy. The system must detect the correct song automatically based on metadata and duration, retry failed downloads, and cache lookups to improve speed and reduce redundancy. Goal: achieve near-perfect recognition of correct tracks from YouTube or Spotify.


2. Tunebat Stability & Flexibility
Fix intermittent Tunebat crashes by adding auto-retry logic and fallback handling when pages fail. Cache results locally to minimize repeat requests. Ensure 99.9% success in BPM and Key retrieval, with a proper log for failed metadata lookups.


3. TikTok Integration (Sixth Channel)
Add TikTok as the sixth integrated upload channel, using the same metadata structure and automation flow as YouTube. Ensure titles, descriptions, comments, and thumbnails carry over accurately, with upload retry logic and logging. The TikTok upload toggle must appear within the UI, maintaining performance parity and clean synchronization with other uploads.

4. Final Reliability Deliverables & Testing Protocol
To ensure production-level reliability, the app must include robust logging, recovery, and verification systems:

• Centralized Logging:
  - Maintain run_report.json, retry_queue.json, and error_log.txt.
  - Track every success/failure by timestamp.

• Crash Recovery:
  - Resume from the last checkpoint (playlist, song, or stem level).
  - Include persistent cache state.

• Validation Checks:
  - Confirm non-empty stems before upload.
  - Post-upload verification with returned video ID.

• Config Consolidation:
  - Unified config.json or .env for all API keys and directories.

• Setup & Maintenance:
  - requirements.txt cleanup and dependency version pinning.
  - Include setup.sh or install.bat for auto environment setup.

• Final Test:
  - Fuzzy match ≥99%.
  - Tunebat auto-retry stable.
  - UI sync confirmed.
  - YouTube and TikTok uploads verified.
  - Performance benchmark: 10 songs ≤7 minutes.
