Sample Split — Two-Step Developer Brief

1. Upgrade Demucs + Fix Stem/Instrumental Accuracy (Main Technical Fix)

This is the first priority. This is not new work — it is simply correcting and optimizing what already exists.

What this includes:
- Upgrade to the newest Demucs ( htdemucs_ft - best quality)
- Fix the weak 'other' stem (new version contains full instruments)
- Apply correct stem mapping:
  • Acapella → vocals
  • Drums → drums
  • Bass → bass
  • Melody → other (new other = full instruments)
  • Instrumental → other + drums + bass
- Ensure stems are clean, consistent, and same loudness
- Code may be refactored or rewritten if needed for speed + quality
- Faster instrumental combining if possible
- All improvements remain invisible to the user

Goal: Stems must be accurate, consistent, and ready for upload automation.

2. Wire the New UI to the Backend (After Stems Are Fixed)

Once the stem engine is clean and correct, connect the new interface so everything works the same as before — but with the added comment box.

What this includes:
- Link new UI buttons/toggles to backend
- Description auto-fills if left empty
- Tags auto-fill if left empty
- Comments now behave the same way (auto or manual)
- Comments post automatically at publish time
- Comment should appear as the top comment
- Visibility defaults to Public
- Scheduling works like before
- Multi-channel upload behavior stays intact
- Backend files may be rewritten/cleaned for optimization:
  • content_download_main.py
  • content_base.py
  • dispatch_download.py
  • yt_video_multi.py
  • tk.py

Goal: The new UI feels identical to the old experience, but more organized, with comment support and full backend wiring.

One-Line Summary

Fix stems with newest Demucs first, then wire the new UI so description, tags, comments, scheduling, and uploads all work exactly like before — clean, simple, optimized.
